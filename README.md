## Installation and Dependencies 

All code and experiments were developed in MATLAB R2017b.

### MATLAB 
Sergii Iglin's [grTheory toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4266-grtheory-graph-theory-toolbox) is used, as well as Guillaume Jacquenot's [polygon intersection code](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18173-polygon-intersection). Both packages are included in the source code (`src/icra/matlab`).

## Usage 

### Plotting Script
The code for our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06675) above
To generate the plots in our paper, run the script `matlab/plot_ral_figures.m`. This script uses the `.mat` files in `src/icra/data/`, which can be re-generated with the script `src/icra/matlab/generate_icra2018_paper_results.m`. 


### Calibration Example Script
The code for our [RSS 2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00188) listed above is in the folder `src/rss`. To reproduce the plots run `src/rss/matlab/generate_KITTI_plot.m`, which uses data generated by `src/rss/matlab/generate_KITTI_result.m`.
